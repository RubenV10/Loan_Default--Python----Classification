# Loan_Default (Python) - Classification
 Predicting Customer Loan Default in Python
### This was one of the first projects I undertook in the Data Analytics certificate program I was enrolled in at UT Austin. I have since revisited this project to update the project with what I have learned since then. The goal of this project is to see if we are able to predict what customers will default on their loan. We can also find out what features i.e. factors are the most important in predicting what customers will default. I like this project because it deals with negative customer behavior within a financial institution. This project made me start to think how this methodlogy of looking at data can be applied to the Anti-Money Laundering field.
